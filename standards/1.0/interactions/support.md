# SUPPORT

The SUPPORT interaction claims that the caller promises to fund an existed topic with some amount of token. Itâ€™s used
when a user finds a topic created by others interesting or useful to himself/herself. If the caller is the creator, it
means the creator will fund more to the topic. A SUPPORT interaction will fail if the target topic
is [resolved](./resolve.md).

# Standard

The format of a NEW interaction is `0x{bytes(osn:q:1:S:{token_identifier}:{token_amount}:{topic_ipfs_cid})}`. It means
the extrinsic caller promises to fund an existed topic with some amount of token.

There are 7 items in this interaction:

- `osn`: it just means OpenSquare Network.
- `q`: it means qa collaboration.
- `1`: it means the qa spec version.
- `S`: it's the abbreviation of SUPPORT, directive to support an existed topic.
- `token_identifier`: it identifies a token, described in [token identifier](../entities/token-identifier.md) entity.
- `token_amount`: how many tokens to fund this topic, described at [token amount](../entities/token-amount.md) entity.
- `topic_ipfs_cid`: ipfs CID of a [topic](../entities/topic.md) entity.
